# The Great Shawville Fire of 1906 – A Map of Destruction

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a visual map of the trail of the Great Shawville Fire of 1906. Using the Shawville Equity newspaper scans and StoryMap, I documented the destruction to each building in the town of Shawville along Main Street that occurred on September 12, 1906. My thought process was to allow the reader to make a connection between the information presented in the newspaper and a physical location; making the reader feel as if they were actually witnessing the fire’s path of destruction, even though it occurred over 100 years ago.


I began this project with the idea of using the Shawville Equity newspaper to research the Great Fire of 1906 that occurred in the main core of Shawville, Quebec. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed a common trend of downtown fires occurring in small towns in Canada around the early 1900s. Incorporating my interest in architecture, I wanted to see if I could map the loss of heritage buildings in a downtown core. Using the Equity newspapers, I would begin by identifying the frequency of the word “fire” (and similar words) within the years of 1906-1916. Searching the word “fire” would help me locate articles in the newspaper that included the mention of fires, and from there I would read and identify any mention of buildings lost to fires in Shawville. I would then be able to map the path of the fires, focusing primarily on the Great Fire of 1906.


Using Lexos, I was able to create three Word Clouds for the years 1906, 1916, and 2006.

In 1906, September 13th and September 20th were examined.

In 1916, February 10th was examined. This was after the Parliament Buildings burned down on February 3rd, 1916.

In 2006, September 13th and September 20th were examined.

I then examined the frequencies of the words: fire, burn, destroy, blaze, house, street, home, and buildings. I realized after the analysis that what I should have done was compare newspaper dates that WERE NOT the dates I knew the fires occurred on, with the dates above. Then I could have confirmed that there was an increase in the frequency of the words listed below in the pie graphs.

While trying to work with the Shawville Equity dataset, one of my main challenges was the bad OCR. This caused my text files to appear messy and disorganized. Because I wasn’t able to read the text files clearly, I had to refer directly to the scanned PDFs of the newspaper articles. The main issue I ran into during my analysis, which ultimately caused my project to remain incomplete, was that I found that the buildings were often not referred to by the street address but by the occupatation or use. For example W.H. Lucas Bake Shop, The Post Office, etc., were areas mentioned in the article titled “*Shawville Fire-Swept*”. Unfortunately these buildings were either destroy by the fire or lost with time and I had no way to reference the buildings on modern Google Maps. One solution to this would be to get a hold of old maps of the town of Shawville, as well as land registry information to cross reference owners with locations.
